what does it mean by this snippet?

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12"></div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12"></div>
    </div>
</div>

here, i am giving div bootstrap container class which gives this div 80% height and make it responsive.

inside container div, i am giving row class to child div.

row and col are used to create layout.

row mean place this div horizontally on window.

in that row, there are two divs with class col-lg-6, and col-md-12.

it means that in large screen devices, i want to give 6 column space to each div.
and in medium size device, i want to give 12 column space.

so, here i am using bootstrap grid system, so that i don't need to write media queries to handle responsiveness of this website.

<div class="d-flex flex-row flex-wrap"></div>

using bootstrap flex system

d-flex means dispaly flex
flex-row means flex direction row
flex-wrap means flex-wrap: wrap

when width of this device is less than content, that time flex-wrap will move the content to next line.

<img src="" alt="" class="img-fluid">

making image responsive using img-fluid class.

what is background clip property?

what is difference between .button.primary-btn and .button .primary-btn?

what is the use of transition property?

what we can do with transition property?

CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

like if a button height, width are 100px.

and we want to change button width on hover smoothly, that time we can apply this below css rule to that button.

button{
    width:100px;
    height:100px;
    transform: width 2s;
}

button:hover{
    width:400px;
}

and if i want to change two properties when hover on button, that time i can do this.

button{
    width:100px;
    height:100px;
    background: white;
    transform: width 2s, background 3s;
}

button:hover{
    width:400px;
    background: yellow;
}

things i have noticed while coding this personal Portfolio website is that, i have not given hard coded width or height to any div or image or button.

also, i have created variables in css to use them where i need.

added boostrap by adding its javascript and css file in respective js and css folders.

added google fonts by downloading them and placing their files in fonts folder. and then using those font file which are in ttf format to create font face.
