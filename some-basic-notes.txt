what does it mean by this snippet?

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12"></div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12"></div>
    </div>
</div>

here, i am giving div bootstrap container class which gives this div 80% height and make it responsive.

inside container div, i am giving row class to child div.

row and col are used to create layout.

row mean place this div horizontally on window.

in that row, there are two divs with class col-lg-6, and col-md-12.

it means that in large screen devices, i want to give 6 column space to each div.
and in medium size device, i want to give 12 column space.

so, here i am using bootstrap grid system, so that i don't need to write media queries to handle responsiveness of this website.

<div class="d-flex flex-row flex-wrap"></div>

using bootstrap flex system

d-flex means dispaly flex
flex-row means flex direction row
flex-wrap means flex-wrap: wrap

when width of this device is less than content, that time flex-wrap will move the content to next line.

<img src="" alt="" class="img-fluid">

making image responsive using img-fluid class.
